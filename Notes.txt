Scalability And Security

HTML: 

Document Object Model-
html-> head-> title
html->body ->Hello World 

Js ability to modify Webbpages Using DOM Model

In HTML Single Elements Have No Closing Tag Beacause They Dose Not Contain Anything In Between It

CSS

attribute like declaring Class or id in CSS

margin fot add outside of of element
padding to add size inside in element

id can be used for declare unique id it can accesssed by using # It mean # mean slect only pertifvular part

class is used to use if we want to use nultiple time it can access by . 

c
  
specofocity-> inline, id, class, type 

CSS Selctorrs
a, b-> Multiple ELement
a b -> Descendant Selector
a > b -> child selector
a + b -> Ajacemt Sobling Selector
[a=b] -> Attribute Selector
a:b -> Pseudoclass Selector
a::b -> Pseudoelelement Selector


This Line Is Very Important To Make Webpage Responsive
<meta name="viewpory" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

also using @media mix and max width we can make responsove;
And Width Must Be In Accending Order

using flex and flexbox we can make webpages more responsive like in div tag 
div {
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
        }

Alrernative for Flex is Gridview We Need To Specify Some Attributes Like coloum gap, row gap and grind coloum template Too


Boostrap Is Very Simple All I Have TO DO IS To Just Get Right Boostrap File And Class Names
To Use Boostrap Only Need TO Use CommanSense And I Know Element I'm Using And What Is Purpose Of It
And Which Code Should I Copy From Boostrap Or Which Class Should Give As Attribute To Element


Sass IN CSS

Sass Is Great It IS used to avoid repetaion of code redency of code

It Has extenion is .scss

we have to compile it to .css file using sass

it uses inheritance
in it we can declare veriables

But veriables in css make more powerful to css and its easy to use than sass and no need to do anything Extra 

Css veribales are good for me explore it more

I can push code on my repo 

And I can also pull code from my repo using my repo url

And can also access my coworkers code by cloning repo in my git account

And most important I can revert my code what I changed in code

Some Usefull commands with sequence of it

to clone repo on local device-> $git clone https://github.com/learningCodings/learningHTML.git;

to add file-> $git add filename;
