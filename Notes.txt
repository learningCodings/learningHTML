Scalability And Security

HTML: 

Document Object Model-
html-> head-> title
html->body ->Hello World 

Js ability to modify Webbpages Using DOM Model

In HTML Single Elements Have No Closing Tag Beacause They Dose Not Contain Anything In Between It

CSS

attribute like declaring Class or id in CSS

margin fot add outside of of element
padding to add size inside in element

id can be used for declare unique id it can accesssed by using # It mean # mean slect only pertifvular part

class is used to use if we want to use nultiple time it can access by . 

c
  
specofocity-> inline, id, class, type 

CSS Selctorrs
a, b-> Multiple ELement
a b -> Descendant Selector
a > b -> child selector
a + b -> Ajacemt Sobling Selector
[a=b] -> Attribute Selector
a:b -> Pseudoclass Selector
a::b -> Pseudoelelement Selector


This Line Is Very Important To Make Webpage Responsive
<meta name="viewpory" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

also using @media mix and max width we can make responsove;
And Width Must Be In Accending Order

using flex and flexbox we can make webpages more responsive like in div tag 
div {
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
        }

Alrernative for Flex is Gridview We Need To Specify Some Attributes Like coloum gap, row gap and grind coloum template Too


Boostrap Is Very Simple All I Have TO DO IS To Just Get Right Boostrap File And Class Names
To Use Boostrap Only Need TO Use CommanSense And I Know Element I'm Using And What Is Purpose Of It
And Which Code Should I Copy From Boostrap Or Which Class Should Give As Attribute To Element


Sass IN CSS

Sass Is Great It IS used to avoid repetaion of code redency of code

It Has extenion is .scss

we have to compile it to .css file using sass

it uses inheritance
in it we can declare veriables

But veriables in css make more powerful to css and its easy to use than sass and no need to do anything Extra 

Css veribales are good for me explore it more

Git: It Is A "Distrubted Version Control Tool" And I can perfom actions by using command line and also on github.com

Some Features OF Git

I can work on repository == repo, with multiple Developers

I can push code on my repo 

And I can also pull code from my repo using my repo url

And can also access my coworkers code by cloning repo in my git account

And most important I can revert my code what I changed in code

Some Usefull commands with sequence of it

to clone repo on local device-> $git clone https://github.com/learningCodings/learningHTML.git;

to add file-> $git add filename;
to add multiple files at one time-> $git add .;

to give comment on it-> $git commit -m "-m is used for this message";

to upload or push code on git-> $git push;

to remove or delete or undo last comment-> $git revert;

to comment & push already added files-> $git commit -am "-am Means Add This Comment To All Files That Currently on the way to push";

to get all changes in code-> $git log;

to download or pull code from already cloned repo-> $git pull;

to test code without changing main code by creating branch-> $git checkout -b branchName;
and after it automatically switch to that new branch
And Automatically new branch became HEAD (Know More About Head May Be At Line N0: 169)
and git command impact is only on branch repo

And Additionally I've to give permission to make changes also on my Github account then I've to give permission-> $git push --set-upstream origin testBranch;

if I want to switch my repo in between it-> $git checkout repoName;

after testing code and its working then if I want to add that Code In Main Branch then(in that branch)-> $git merge main; 

and after adding test branch code in main branch if I want to delete it then-> $git rebase;

after creating branch it is called as feature branch and main branch as master branch 
and on which branch I'm working it is called as HEAD s

to check last comment & current repo location-> $git checkout;

to check is any thing remains to push or what remains to push-> $git status;

/*Testing Git pull command what if I did not push and I'm directly pull code*/

/* 
Its Not Working first I've to push then pull then push

Some times it get complicated for me I can manage it by accepting both changes*/

It is called merge confict

it shows my changes as Head vs & remote changes as conflicting commit

It can be solved by accepting both changes or keeping only one change
